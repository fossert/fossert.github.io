		<h2>Manual &amp; movement therapy with a neural twist. </h2>
        <p>We now know that the brain is in charge of everything in a human body. Our brain is our body's controller. 
        At Fossé Restorative Therapy (FRT), I use brain-based manual therapy and movement therapy to help my patients. What does this mean? 
        If one comes to me with pain, I will begin by listening to my patient's history and looking at how they move. 
        I will build a matrix of how well their movement and physiological (nervous) system(s) are functioning. 
        Together we will work on discovering and correcting the issue. When the brain gets properly refragmented the body begins to perform at a higher level. 
        Better brain is better movement &mdash; better movement is less pain.
        I can help you build a better body composition, improve performance, and reduce injury.</p>
        <h3>Fossé Restorative Therapy is run by Nathalie Fossé, PhD, licensed massage therapist, certified Z-Health Performance trainer, yoga instructor, and personal trainer.</h3>
